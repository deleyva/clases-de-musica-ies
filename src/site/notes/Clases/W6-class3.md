  <h2>Ars Antiqua vs. Ars Nova</h2>
  <p>Today, we will explore two important musical styles of the Middle Ages: Ars Antiqua and Ars Nova.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>What is Ars Antiqua?</h2>
  <p><strong>Ars Antiqua</strong> (Old Art) is the name given to the European music style that developed between the 12th and 13th centuries. It is characterized by a significant advance in polyphonic music, where multiple melodies were sung simultaneously, creating a richer and more complex texture.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Characteristics of Ars Antiqua</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple polyphony, with voices often moving in parallel.</li>
    <li>Relatively simple rhythms.</li>
    <li>Use of <strong>modal notation</strong>, an early system for writing rhythms.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Main Authors of Ars Antiqua</h2>
  <p><strong>Léonin</strong>: One of the first composers of Ars Antiqua. He was prominent at the Notre Dame School in Paris, composing for the cathedral choir.</p>
  <p><strong>Pérotin</strong>: A composer who continued Léonin's work, further developing polyphony by adding more voices to his compositions, creating more complex works.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>What is Ars Nova?</h2>
  <p><strong>Ars Nova</strong> (New Art) is the music style that developed in the 14th century, particularly in France and Italy. Unlike Ars Antiqua, Ars Nova brought significant changes in how music was written and understood.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Characteristics of Ars Nova</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Greater rhythmic freedom, thanks to the use of <strong>mensural notation</strong>, which allowed for more complex rhythms.</li>
    <li>Music became more expressive and often addressed secular themes (i.e., non-religious).</li>
    <li>Increased number of voices used in a composition, resulting in a more elaborate sound.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Main Authors of Ars Nova</h2>
  <p><strong>Philippe de Vitry</strong>: One of the main theorists of Ars Nova. He wrote a treatise titled <em>"Ars Nova"</em> that gave the movement its name.</p>
  <p><strong>Guillaume de Machaut</strong>: Composer and poet, considered the most important figure of Ars Nova. He was one of the first to write complete polyphonic masses, like the famous <em>Messe de Nostre Dame</em>.</p>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Differences Between Ars Antiqua and Ars Nova</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: In Ars Antiqua, the rhythm was simpler and more repetitive, whereas Ars Nova had more advanced rhythmic notation, allowing for much more varied and complex rhythms.</li>
    <li><strong>Theme</strong>: Ars Antiqua focused more on religious music, while Ars Nova also incorporated secular themes, such as love and nature.</li>
    <li><strong>Polyphony</strong>: Although both used polyphony, Ars Nova was more developed, with more voices and a greater variety of rhythms.</li>
