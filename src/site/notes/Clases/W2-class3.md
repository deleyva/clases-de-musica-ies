### Una ola

Una ola con su cola viene conmigo a bailar,
Ya se aleja, ya se acerca, a la costa va a llegar.

I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning, I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets I used to own

</div>
<div class="slide">

I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
Now the old king is dead, long live the king  
One minute, I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

</div>
<div class="slide">

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason, I can't explain  
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word  
And that was when I ruled the world

</div>
<div class="slide">

It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?
